My first readme

  1. Repo-session

Create a new directory called git in your repo.
/holbertonschool-zero_day# mkdir git

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:
->at the root of your repository
/holbertonschool-zero_day# echo README.md in holbertonschool-zero_day> README.md

->AND in the directory git
/holbertonschool-zero_day/git# echo README.md in holbertonschool-zero_day> README.md

And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.
git add /holbertonschool-zero_day
git commit -m '1. Repo-session' 
git push
